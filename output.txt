Let’s suppose you have written 100 lines of code and you saved it with the name “Folder 1” and then after someday you thought of adding or changing something in it but you don’t want to disturb the version 1 directory so you created a new directory “Folder 2” and copied all the code of version 1 in it and started working on it, but after the modification, you saw that the code is not working properly, so you revert to version 1 directory. This is how you can keep track of the files using the Local Version Control System.
