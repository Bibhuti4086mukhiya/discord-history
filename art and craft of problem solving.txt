2.1 Psychological Strategies :
good problem solver doesn 't give up. 
work on harder and harder problems that continually challenge and stretch you to the limit.

solving strategies:
1.Just because a problem seems impossible does not mean that it is impossible.
2.Never admit defeat after a cursory glance.
Begin optimistically; assume that the problem can be solved.
4.Only after several failed attempts should you try to prove impossibility. 
5.If you cannot do so, then do not admit defeat. Go back to the problem later.

at beginning,
take one 's time to understand a problem
have optimistic attitude
making the problem easier

chapter 2 (2.2 Strategies for Getting Started)
practical strategies for solving problems
The First Step: Orientation
Read the problem carefully. identify positive vs. negative, finite vs. infinite,
Begin to classify: "to find" or "to prove" problem? Is the problem similar to others you have seen?
Carefully identify the hypothesis and the conclusion.
Try some quick preliminary brainstorming: 
Think about process. 
particular method of argument  seem?
guess a possible solution
words or concepts that seem important in question

When you finish PROBLEM (and don 't rush ! ), go back and do it again
rethink classification, hypothesis and conclusion, ask yourself "what you have already formulated."
Don 't spend too much time on orientation
It is important to keep in mind that any progress is OK. Never be in a hurry to solve a problem!
Time spent thinking about a problem is always time worth spent. Even if you seem to make no progress at all.

Methods of Argument
every problem,
the investigation, during which you discover what is going on
the argument, in which you convince others (or maybe just yourself! ) of your discoveries.
Arguments should be rigorous and clear
Type of Arguments: straightforward deduction, contradiction,  mathematical induction
Common Abbreviations and Stylistic Conventions 
arguments  with clear statements hypothesis and conclusion
QED "which was to be demonstrated"
AWD "and we 're done"
W5 "which was what we wanted"
Common mathematical verbs are >,<,=,implies, subset, is equivalent to
u explore the penultimate step of an argument (TS and ISTS ("to show" and "it is sufficient to show")
use a simple variable

Deduction and Symbolic Logic
Argument by Contradiction 
Instead of trying to prove something directly, we start by assuming that it is false,  A contradiction argument 
is usually helpful for proving directly that something cannot happen.

Anything that furthers your investigation is worth doing
Mathematical Induction:
• The sum of the interior angles of any n-gon is 1 80(n - 2) degrees . 
• The inequality n! > 2
n is true for all positive integers n => 4. 
bibhuti mukhiya — 07/06/2023 2:28 PM
Standard Induction
Establish the truth of P(no). This is called the "base case," and it is usually an easy exercise.
Assume that P(n) is true for some arbitrary integer n. This is called the inductive hypothesis. Then show that the inductive hypothesis implies that P( n + 1) is also true.
example of it is : line of brick fall down, right or left

Pictures Don't Help? Recast the Problem in Other Ways
analytic geometry, which converts pictures into algebra, a problem that is geometric on the surface, but not at its core.
Change Your Point of View 
Changing the point of view is just another manifestation of peripheral vision.
Sometimes a problem is hard only because we choose the "wrong" point of view.
Spending a few minutes searching for the "natural" point of view can pay big dividends.

even if you have no idea how to define these two terms, then you are often on the right track.
Why is symmetry important?
The strategic principles of peripheral vision and rule-breaking tell us to look for symmetry in unlikely places, and not to worry if something is almost, but not quite symmetrical.
An informal alternate definition of symmetry is "harmony." This is even vaguer than our "formal" definition, but it is not without value. Look for harmony, and beauty, whenever you investigate a problem. If you can do something that
makes things more harmonious or more beautiful

The Pigeonhole Principle
If you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, and you try to stuff the 
pigeons into the holes, then at least one hole must contain at least two 
pigeons.

bibhuti mukhiya — 07/23/2023 12:33 PM
The pigeonhole principle is a problem-solving approach used in combinatorics. It involves three steps: 
Recognizing when the principle is applicable.
Identifying the items (pigeons) and categories (holes) relevant to the problem.
After applying the principle, additional steps may be needed for the final solution. The skilled problem solver plans for this.
The "penultimate step" is a vital intermediate stage in problem-solving, leading closer to the final solution, acting as a crucial link between the initial approach and the successful outcome, but additional steps are needed for the ultimate resolution.

intermediate Pigeonhole
If you have p pigeons and h holes. then at least one of the holes 
contains at least r p / h 1 pigeons.
p > h, so the quantity [ p / h ]is at least 2.

Even integers are divisible by 2, odd integers are not. Parity of a sum is odd if odd elements in the set are odd. Parity of a product is odd if there are no even elements.
Sure, let's explain with an example:

Example:
Consider the set of integers {2, 5, -4, 7}.

Parity of a sum:
Add all the integers in the set: 2 + 5 + (-4) + 7 = 10
Count the number of odd elements: There are two odd elements (5 and 7).

The sum is even because it's divisible by 2. In this case, the number of odd elements is even (2 odd elements), and according to the first fact, the sum is even.

Parity of a product:
Multiply all the integers in the set: 2 * 5 * (-4) * 7 = -280
Check for even elements: There is one even element (2).

The product is even because it's divisible by 2. In this case, there is at least one even element, and according to the second fact, the product is even.

To summarize, in this example:
The sum of the set is even because it has an even number of odd elements.
The product of the set is even because it contains at least one even element.

chapter 4: Three Important Crossover Tactics
If a graph has 10 vertices and 10 edges, must it contain a cycle? 
A connected graph that contains no cycles is called a tree.
A non-connected graph containing no cycles is called a forest; each of its connected components is a tree.
Every tree with two or more vertices has at least two leaves. 
Graph Theory which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relationships between objects. A graph consists of a set of vertices (also known as nodes) and a set of edges (also known as links or connections) that connect pairs of vertices.

bibhuti mukhiya — 08/05/2023 1:33 PM
Trees: The number of edges in a tree is one less than the number of vertices.
Graphs with e edges and v vertices, where e > 2v, must contain a cycle.
A connected graph (or multigraph) has a path that traverses every edge exactly once if it has either zero or exactly two odd-degree vertices. This path is called an Eulerian path.

Complex Numbers
complex numbers have unique properties, making them a crossover between algebraic and geometric concepts.
expressed in the form a + bi, where "a" and "b" are real numbers, and "i" represents the imaginary unit (√-1). In this representation, "a" is called the real part of the complex number, and "bi" is the imaginary part. The imaginary unit "i" is defined as i^2 = -1. 
bibhuti mukhiya — 08/09/2023 12:39 PM
Complex numbers are represented as (z = a + bi), where (a) is the real part and (b). coordinate of a point in a two-dimensional plane. This point is also viewed as the endpoint of a vector starting at the origin.

The dual nature of (z = a + bi) is highlighted: it's both a point with coordinates ((a, b)) and a vector originating from the origin and terminating at ((a, b)). It's emphasized that vectors can originate from any point, not solely the origin, and they are defined by their magnitude and direction. For (z = a + bi), the magnitude (|z|) is computed as the square root of the sum of the squares of (a) and (b), i.e., (|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}).

0=tetha
z = r(cos 0 + i sin 0). This is called the polar form of z.
cos 0 + i sin 0 is Cis 0;
z = r Cis 0.

zw = (rCis a) (sCis f3 ) = rs Cis (a + f3); 
The length of zw is the product of the lengths of z and w, and the angle of zw is the sum of the angles of z and w.

Since i(a + bi) = -b + ai,
"Multiplication by i" means "rotate by n/2 counterclockwise:' 
Likewise, if a is real,
"Multiplication by a" means "expand by a factor of a." 
For example, multiplication of a complex vector z by 3 produces a new vector 
that has the same direction, but is three times as long. Multiplication of z by 1 15 
produces a vector with the same direction, but only 1 15 as long. 
Multiplying z by 3 + 4i = 5 Cis e means that z is turned into (3 + 4i)z = 3z + 4iz.
This is the sum of two vectors, 3z and 4iz. The first vector is just z expanded by a 
factor of 3. The second vector is z rotated by 90 degrees counterclockwise, then 
expanded by a factor of 4. So the net result will be a vector with length 5 1z1 and angle e + arg z.
Clearly this argument generalizes to multiplication by any complex number. 
Multiplication by the complex number rCis e is a counterclockwise rotation by e followed by stretching by the factor r.

(b) Re z = -1 (z + z) and 1m z = d:z (z - z):
(c) zz = Iz1^2: 

(d) The midpoint of the line segment joining the complex numbers z, w is (z+w)/2: 
(e) z+w = z+w and zw = zw and z/w = z/w: 

(f) (1 + i)^10 = 32i and (1 - √3i)^5 = 16(1 + √3i): 
(g) Show by drawing a picture that z = √(1 + i) satisfies z^2 = i: 

(h) Describing a circle with center at a and radius r: This statement is correct. When you take a complex number a and add a radius r multiplied by the complex unit vector eiθ (where θ varies from 0 to 2π), you get a set of points that forms a circle with center a and radius r.

(i) Area of the triangle with vertices at O, a, and b: The area of a triangle with vertices at complex numbers O (origin), a, and b is given by one-half of the absolute value of the cross product of vectors formed by the sides aO and aB. In terms of complex numbers, this can be represented as (1/2) * |Im(ab)|, where Im(ab) is the imaginary part of the product ab.

Partitions refers to a concept in combinatorics, which is the branch of mathematics that deals with counting and arranging objects.
A partition of a positive integer n is a way of representing n as a sum of positive integers. In other words, it's a way of breaking down n into a set of smaller positive integers. Each of these smaller positive integers is called a part. For example, the partitions of 4 are:
4
3 + 1
2 + 2
2 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1
The study of partitions involves understanding how many ways a given number can be partitioned and exploring the properties of these partitions.

Multiplication rarely simplifies things. Instead, you should 
Factor relentlessly. ex: 2x + 4x^2 = x(2 + 4x)

Manipulating Squares
*Creating Perfect Squares:**
Squaring Integers:
3^2 = 9
(-5)^2 = 25
Completing the Square:
Example: x^2 + 6x = (x + 3)^2 - 9

Recognizing Perfect Squares:
 Pattern Recognition: 
1^2 = 1
11^2 = 121
111^2 = 12321
1111^2 = 1234321
Square Roots: 
√9 = 3 (9 is a perfect square)
√16 = 4 (16 is a perfect square)

 Algebraic Recognition: 
x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2
Difference of Squares: An expression of the form a^2 - b^2 is a difference of squares and can be factored into (a + b)(a - b). For example:
25 - 16 = (5 + 4)(5 - 4)

Quadratic Equations: 
x^2 - 6x + 9 = (x - 3)^2

Substitutions:
 replacing one element, variable, term, or expression with another. simplify an equation, expression, or problem.  solve for a variable by replacing it with a known value.
 In programming, replacing certain values or variables with their corresponding values or computations. Substitutions can help transform a problem into a more understandable or solvable form.

Simplifications:
reducing a complex expression, equation, or problem into a simpler form while retaining its essential characteristics.  makes the problem easier to analyze, understand, and solve. simplification combining like terms, factoring, canceling out common factors, or reducing fractions to their simplest forms.
In programming, simplification could mean writing code in a more concise and efficient way without sacrificing functionality.

geometric series. 
There are many ways to determine whether a given series converges or diverges. 
The simplest principles, however, are 
• If }:ak < infinite (Le., the series converges) and the ak dominate all but a finite 
number of the hk (Le., ak 2 hk for all but a finite number of values of k), then 
}: hk < infinite• 
• Likewise, if }:ak = infinite (Le., the series diverges) and the hk dominate all but a 
finite number of the ab then }: hk = infinite. 
In other words, the simplest strategy when dealing with an unknown infinite series 
is to find a known series to compare it to. One fundamental series that you should 
know well is the harmonic series

Polynomials
Polynomial Definition: A[x] is the set of all polynomials with coefficients from a set of numbers A.
Coefficient Sets: integers (Z), rational numbers (Q), real numbers (R), and complex numbers (C) and integers modulo n (Zn).
Terms and Monomials: ajxi, is referred to as a term or monomial. These terms consist of a coefficient (ai) multiplied by a power of the variable x.
Notation: Consistent notation is emphasized as a way to prevent errors and confusion when working with polynomials. The coefficient ai is specifically labeled as the coefficient of x^i.
Degree of a Polynomial: The degree of a polynomial is defined as the highest exponent of the variable x that has a non-zero coefficient. The coefficient of this highest-degree term is also known as the leading coefficient.
Monic Polynomials: If the leading coefficient of a polynomial is 1, the polynomial is called monic.
Constant Term: The coefficient a0 is referred to as the constant term of the polynomial.

Polynomial Operations 
Multiplication of Polynomials: notation for polynomial multiplication, denoting the product of two polynomials A(x) and B(x) as C(x).
Polynomial Division:  polynomials can be divided like integers, resulting in a quotient and remainder.
