different between:
exercise:   question that you already know how to answer, even if the process is difficult.
problem:  A problem is a question that you do not know how to answer, at least initially; it requires investigation.

chapter 1: Three Levels of Problem Solving
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/14/2023 11:32 AM
Three Levels of Problem Solving:
At beginner state,  best way to do in simple way or a more organized approach. 
First, think strategically. Don't try immediately to solve the problem, but instead think 
about it on a less focused level.
1.first investigation 
2.randomly try whatever comes into head.
3.The goal of strategic thinking is to come up with a plan  which leads to an "improved" situation.

level 1: repeating all question in paper 
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/14/2023 12:57 PM
solving second last question: 15,urtyp,17,neuli,16,schlurchi,25,tokay,75,horni,35,sue,60,sue,70
tokay is highest bid and finding at which price buy by tokay 
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/14/2023 1:22 PM
tokay,71
work on code level 1:visual studio, python

chapter 1 : From Mountaineering to Mathematics
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/15/2023 12:30 PM
To solve the problem:
divide the problem into hypothesis and conclusion.
hypothesis: the given question
conclusion: problem to find or prove.
1.analyze this problem
2.reading the problem carefully
3.strategy: try to focus on goal.
tool : recognizing a common things.

try to store highest bid
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/15/2023 2:30 PM
level 1 : last question solving, make code give all answer 
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/15/2023 3:40 PM
start level 2: same as level 1 but there need highest bid find
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/15/2023 4:31 PM
use "if" only for go in each line of code 
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/16/2023 12:00 PM
chapter 1 : From Mountaineering to Mathematics
undetermined coefficients is a "guess and check" 
method for solving problem 
chapter 1 : a problem sampler
three type are 
1.recreational 
2.contest 
3.open-ended.

recreational problems
Problems "to find" ask for a specific piece of  information, 
while problems "to prove" require a more general argument
Recreational activities is developed creativity and increase logical thinking. example puzzle, math games

Contest Problems
written exams with time limits by student

open-ended problems 
more than one solution

level 2: second last question
one buyer only 
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/16/2023 2:25 PM
second last question have only one bidder so highest bid is 100
work on second last code
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/16/2023 4:25 PM
by comparing(==) bidder name, method trying
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/19/2023 12:37 PM
only one buyer bids many times is solve by list, loop and compare
last question, one buyer bid many times and other only one times, try to solve by if statement method. 
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/19/2023 1:25 PM
level 2 last question, try to replace first price with new highest price 
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/19/2023 1:59 PM
level 2 last question, there is two buyer only bidding so extract first  bid's C and  G's bid and last bid of any.
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/19/2023 2:55 PM
last question complete with if statement  and replace first price with new highest price. 
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/19/2023 3:04 PM
analysis :level 3 question 
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/19/2023 3:39 PM
analysis level 3 example similar as level 1,2 but output is current price and highest price all step.
try to solve example of level 3. 
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/19/2023 4:30 PM
have to store all result  and print 
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/20/2023 12:49 PM
level 3 trying by applying if, elif and else
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/20/2023 1:20 PM
re-creating logic using if, elif and else
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/20/2023 2:00 PM
debug and coding
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/20/2023 5:17 PM
trying to solve example of level 3 and code have to add more logic (if, and)
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/21/2023 12:44 PM
by debugging make code of level 3 example.

analysis fourth number question in paper. 
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/21/2023 3:06 PM
two times same price of same buyer then not repeat
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/21/2023 4:07 PM
analysis question number last of level 3
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/21/2023 5:15 PM
soving in paper
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/22/2023 12:41 PM
analysis question number last of level 3 again in paper
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/22/2023 1:33 PM
if there name buyer many times and result is name of buyer then write first current price.
bibhuti mukhiya — 06/22/2023 2:28 PM
